## 🕐 The 60-Hour Solar Clock
The day is divided into **60 Nazhigai** (Ghatika) starting from sunrise.
- 1 Nazhigai = 24 minutes
- 1 Vinazhigai = 24 seconds

The arrow in the center shows the Sun's annual journey:
- **↑ Uttarayanam**: Northward journey (approx. Dec 22 - Jun 21)
- **↓ Dakshinayanam**: Southward journey (approx. Jun 22 - Dec 21)

## 🌙 Moon Phases
- The **outer ring** shows the moon phase (Tithi).
- **Shukla Paksha** (Waxing): Moon grows brighter represented with ^ 🌕
- **Krishna Paksha** (Waning): Moon grows darker represented with v 🌑

## 📍 Location
Time is calculated based on your location's sunrise. You can update this in **Settings**.
